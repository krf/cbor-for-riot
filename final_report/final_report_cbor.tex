%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex



%\usepackage{ps4pdf}
% dvi->ps workflow is required to use such packages as psfrag.sty and
% pstricks.sty. However, Rolf Niepraschk's ps4pdf.sty provides a way to
% apply psfrag/pstricks effects to .eps figures and then get the resultant
% figures in .pdf form. Thus, providing an easier way for migrating from
% .eps to .pdf figures. After ps4pdf.sty loads, if:
% 1. producing .dvi output: the output file will consist ONLY of the
%    figures (or other constructs encased within \PSforPDF commands)
% 2. producing .pdf output: pdflatex will look in the filename-pics.pdf
%    file, where filename is the basename of the tex document, for the
%    graphics (or other constructs encased within \PSforPDF commands).
%    NOTE: If you ever change your figures, you must remember to remake
%    the filename-pics.pdf file.
%
% This way you can do a:
% 
% latex filename
% dvips -Ppdf -o filename-pics.ps filename.dvi
% ps2pdf filename-pics.ps filename-pics.pdf
% 
% to produce a filename-pics.pdf graphics container that contains
% .pdf versions of the graphics with psfrag, pstricks, etc. features.
% Note that you will not typically be able to view the figures in 
% filename-pics.ps because of an offset. However, you will be able to
% view them in filename-pics.pdf. Also, note that when ps4pdf is in effect
% with .dvi output, you may get harmless over/under full box warnings - 
% ignore them. 
% Then, run pdflatex:
% 
% pdflatex filename
% 
% to use pdflatex to make PDF output, automatically using the figures in
% filename-pics.pdf. Alternatively, you could use dvips -i option to
% obtain separate .pdf files for each figure:
%
% dvips -Ppdf -i -E -o fig filename
%
% then convert each figure to pdf via a command such as epstopdf and then
% use pdflatex with these pdf figures and then to dispense with ps4pdf.
%
% Remember to rerun through latex/dvips/ps2pdf if you ever change your
% figures so that filename-pics.pdf gets updated.
% ps4pdf requires David Kastrup's preview-latex and a recent LaTeX system
% (circa 2001 or later). The ps4pdf package and documentation can be
% obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ps4pdf/
% The preview-latex package and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/preview/
%
% provide a bogus \PSforPDF, even when not loading pd4pdf. This way we can
% stop loading ps4pdf.sty if we choose to make separate .pdf versions of
% each of our figures.
\providecommand{\PSforPDF}[1]{#1}
% Note that in order for ps4pdf to work, all commands related to psfrag,
% pstricks, etc. must be called within the PSforPDF command. This applies
% even when *loading* via \usepackage psfrag.sty, etc.


%\PSforPDF{\usepackage{psfrag}}
% psfrag.sty was written by Craig Barratt, Michael C. Grant, and
% David Carlisle. It allows you to substitute LaTeX commands for text in
% imported EPS graphic files. In this way, LaTeX symbols can be placed into
% graphics that have been generated by other applications. You must use
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf workflow (not direct pdf output from pdflatex) if
% you wish to use this capability because it works via some PostScript
% tricks. Alternatively, the graphics could be processed as separate files
% via psfrag and dvips, then converted to PDF for inclusion in the main file
% which uses pdflatex. ps4pdf.sty (above) provides a way of doing this all
% at once within the main file.
% Docs are in "The PSfrag System" by Michael C. Grant and David Carlisle.
% There is also some information about using psfrag in "Using Imported
% Graphics in LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which documents the graphicx
% package (see above). The psfrag package and documentation can be obtained
% at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/psfrag/
% 
% Note that the current version of psfrag does not "turn itself off" when
% running under pdf output. This will result in a harmless warning
% about a non-PDF \special. However, to silence this, a bogus psfrag
% command can be provided instead of loading psfrag.sty when PDF output
% is being used. Thus, a more complex alternative conditional loading scheme
% can be employed instead of the straightforword way above:
%
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
% if outputting PDF, do not use or load psfrag.sty as current versions
% output a non-PDF special that generates a harmless, but annoying warning.
% Instead, we provide a bogus \psfrag command that does nothing with
% its arguments. This is a tad tricky because \psfrag can have up to six
% arguments four of which are optional: \psfrag{}[][][][]{}
% Code based on that in psfrag.sty

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/acronym/


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
%\else
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
%\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.

% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/thumbpdf/
% Be sure and use only version 3.8 (2005/07/06) or later of thumbpdf as
% earlier versions will not work properly with recent versions of pdfTeX
% (1.20a and later).

% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, recently Vilar Camara Neto introduced his breakurl.sty
% package which permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi
% mode. Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/breakurl/
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode. Versions 1.10 
% (September 23, 2005) and later are recommened to avoid bugs in earlier
% releases.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that
% their hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version
% 1.6b or later.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/

% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\subsection{Project Goal}
\IEEEPARstart{I}{mplementing} a CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) encoder and decoder for RIOT.

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
\subsection{Motivation}
A CBOR encoder/decoder makes it possible for devices to exchange serialized, compressed binary objects, which in turn could serve several purposes, such as remote procedure calls, message passing, or generally exchanging C data items to be processed on another device.\\
Alternatives to CBOR include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Not compressing at all: bad in case of low bandwidth; converting data structures to strings (serializing) would still need to be implemented, target system would still need to decode the serialized stream
  \item JSON: requires more bandwidth than CBOR
  \item XML: requires more bandwidth than JSON
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Context}
Application-level software project.\\\\
\quelle{\today}

\section{Approach}
Main problems include:

% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\begin{enumerate}
\item Get our initial code to run on RIOT
\item Define API for our CBOR library
\item Implement and test the CBOR encoder and decoder for simple types
\item Implement and test the CBOR encoder and decoder for complex types
\item Test our implementation against other working implementations
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Problems}
\subsubsection{Estimating buffer size}
For serialization, we need to know the size of the CBOR data upfront in order to save the serialized data.
The question was how to design the serialization API in order to guarantee a low memory footprint.\\
\textit{Solution:}\\
We estimate (upper bound) the space needed up front. If the estimated space is insufficient, an error message is printed and the encoding is aborted.\\
Alternative solutions which we briefly considered included:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Running every encode function twice calculating the needed space during the first run, then allocating the needed space, and subsequently running the function a second time, to do the actual encoding. This approach could have saved some space, but the computational overhead was deemed too big a downside.
\item Estimating a very low upper bound for buffer size and increasing it as needed, i.e. every time we run out of space. We gave up this idea due to the non-existence of a functioning free() in RIOT.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decoding stream with unknown items}
The receiving device might not know up front which CBOR items the received CBOR stream contains. A CBOR decoder should be able to decode a stream like this. In C, however, it is not possible for a (decode) function to return an arbitrary number of elements, of previously unknown types.\\
\textit{Solution:}\\
We provide a \textit{cbor\_stream\_decode()} function which takes a CBOR stream as an argument and iterates over said stream item by item. For each new item, the first byte is decoded, determining the major type of the item, and the appropriate CBOR decode function is called. The return value of each decode function is then printed.

\section{Achievements}

\subsection{File Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item /sys/cbor/include/cbor.h (CBOR header)
\item /sys/cbor/cbor.c (CBOR implementation)
\item /tests/unittests/tests-cbor/tests-cbor.c
\end{itemize}

\subsection{API}
All of our \textit{serialize} functions receive a pointer to the CBOR struct where the serialized data is to be stored, and the value to be serialized. Every serialize function checks whether there is enough space left in the CBOR struct before writing any data (\textit{CBOR\_ENSURE\_SIZE}).\\\\
All of our \textit{deserialize} functions receive a pointer to the CBOR struct to read the encoded data from, the offset indicating where in the CBOR stream decoding should begin, and a pointer to the variable where the deserialized data item is to be stored.\\\\
Initially, we intended to \textit{return} the deserialized values for our deserialize functions. Instead we decided to let them return the number of bytes read by them, so that the deserialize function that is called after them knows at which offset to continue.

\item char*
\item struct tm
\item time\_t
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notes About Some Major Types}
\subsubsection{Major Type 3}
Since we do not have a standardized C type for representing Unicode code points, we just provide API to serialize/deserialize @e char* arrays. The user then has to transform that into a meaningful representation
\subsubsection{Major Type 6}
Encoding date and time: date/time strings that follow the standard format described in Section 3.3 of [RFC3339]:\\\\
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
  "2003-12-13T18:30:02Z"         & - supported \\
  "2003-12-13T18:30:02.25Z"      & - not supported \\
  "2003-12-13T18:30:02+01:00"    & - not supported \\
  "2003-12-13T18:30:02.25+01:00" & - not supported \\
\end{tabular}
\\\\\\
Since we do not have C types for representing bignums/bigfloats/decimal-fraction we do not provide API to serialize/deserialize them at all. You can still read out the actual data item behind the tag (via cbor\_deserialize\_byte\_string()) and interpret it yourself.

\subsubsection{Major Type 7}
Simple values:\\\\
\begin{tabular}{ ll p{4.5cm} }
  0-19:   & (Unassigned)    & - not supported \\
  20,21:  & True, False     & - supported \\
  22,23:  & Null, Undefined & - not supported \\
  24-31:  & (Reserved)      & - supported \\
  32-255: & (Unassigned)    & - not supported \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Testing Our Implementation Against Other Working Implementations}
\subsubsection{Python Implementation}
Serialize tests were successful, however the python implementation could not successfully deserialize the output of its own serialize functions.\\
Link: \url{https://github.com/fritz0705/flynn}
\subsubsection{Perl Implementation}
Due to the fact that the serialize functions stored their output in a string, we couldn't find a way to display the actual encoded bytes (printf refused to display anything remotely numeric) and hence couldn't compare with our own encoded items.\\
Link: \url{http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/CBOR-XS/XS.pm}
\subsubsection{JavaScript Implementation}
Very easy to use, worked like a charm. All serialize and deserialize tests were successful.\\
Link: \url{https://github.com/paroga/cbor-js}

\section{Usage Example}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
/* Encoding different types */
cbor_stream_t stream;
char buffer[1024];
cbor_init(&stream, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
cbor_serialize_byte_string(&stream, "abc");
// CBOR stream now contains: 
// 0x43616263

cbor_serialize_uint64_t(&stream, 0);
// CBOR stream now contains:
// 0x43616263 00

cbor_serialize_array(&stream, 2);
cbor_serialize_int(&stream, 1);
cbor_serialize_int(&stream, 2);
// CBOR stream now contains:
// 0x43616263 00 820102

/* Decoding CBOR stream containing unknown items*/
cbor_stream_decode(&stream); 
/* Output:

(int, 0)
(array, length: 2)
  (int, 1)
  (int, 2)
*/

/* Cleaning up */

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% However, Computer Society journals sometimes do use bottom floats - bear
% this in mind when choosing appropriate optional arguments for the
% figure/table environments.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)

% biography section
% 
% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are

% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

%\begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Biography text here.

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.
